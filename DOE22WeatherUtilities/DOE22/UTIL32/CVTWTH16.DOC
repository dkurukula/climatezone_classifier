Copyright (c) 1992 James J. Hirsch (805) 532-1045.  All Rights Reserved.

This program can be used to convert weathers processed by the DOE-2 and
micro-AXCESS weather processors between the different formats used by
various versions of the programs.  The four arguments supplied to the 
program define the input and output file types and names.

This program can handle all current types of files processed by the DOE-2
weather processor.
